                        <p>CodeAcross is a flagship hackathon organized by Civic Tech Toronto for the past 3 years on the Open Data Day (March 3rd, 2018). As design and technology continue to transform our workplace and what it means to be a citizen &mdash; this year we challenge you to redefine The Future of Work. All members of the public are welcomed and encouraged to come.
                        </br> </br>
                        The usual association with the tech industry is private start-ups. However, these amazing technology and skills that we have can be used to contribute to the civic community and public section.
                        Here are some of the questions we try to answer during hacknights:
                        How can we enhance relationship between government and the public?
                        How can we empower everyday citizens to drive change through civic and poltical action?
                        How can we make the City of Toronto budget more transparent and accessible?
                        </br>
