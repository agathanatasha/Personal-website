            	I am in love with programming after my Introduction to Programming course. Since then, I have taken more courses, both online and on campus. I even went to University of Edinburgh for exchange. I have learned to model language evolution with Python, use Festival to make a synthetic voice by unit selection, and artificial intelligence (search-based planning, logical representation and planning, scaling planning for complex tasks, and acting in uncertain (real world) environments with Bayesian Network!
