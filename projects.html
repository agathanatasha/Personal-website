                    This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The
                    main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with
                    Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
                    The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for
                    storing the applicationâ€™s data.
                    The course is worth 3-8 credits, and the content is the same as in the Full stack course held at
                    the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2019. There is also
                    an associated project work that is worth 1-10 credits.

                <p>
                    This course takes a very structured approach of teaching Rails starting with Ruby - the
                    programming
                    language behind Rails. Everything from "Hello World" to Object Oriented Programming is covered.
                    Students acquire skills rapidly; utilizing homework assignments, quizzes, coding exercises and
                    free
                    web based resources to go with the video lectures. The text lectures also provide reference
                    material
                    after each video, it's like having multiple books in addition to the videos to guide students
                    through the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first all the code is done from scratch limiting the use of shortcuts and generators so
                    students
                    can understand what's really going on under the hood of Rails applications and can design them
                    the
                    way they want. Then with solid knowledge and understanding already in place, rapid prototyping
                    methods are introduced in later parts of the course, showing use of generators and scaffolding,
                    finishing with a complete Software as a Service Application that can be used to launch a
                    startup!

                    Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.
                    In
                    the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition,
                    effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning
                    is
                    so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many
                    researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this
                    class,
                    you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice
                    implementing
                    them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the
                    theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly
                    and
                    powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon
                    Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI. This course
                    provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern
                    recognition.
                    Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector
                    machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality
                    reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning
                    (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw
                    from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning
                    algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search,
                    anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

                <p>Mobile apps are such a big part of everyone's life nowadays. I want to have a basic idea of apps

                <p>I really enjoyed my AI course in Edinburgh. I have been trying to learn it myself, but my pace
                    has
                    been quite slow.
                    A university course is a great resource to push myself one step further and to learn large
                    amount
                    of information in a short period of time.</p>

                <p>I did not study a lot of math during my time university. With my interest in machine learning and
                    natural language processing, I am rediscovering the beauty of math starting from linear algebra.

                <p>I first learned about Haskell during my Informatics 2D: Reasoning and Agents class in University
                    of
                    Edinburgh for my first assignment. Before that, I was mostly working on Object-Oriented
                    Languages.
                    I noticed that functional programming employs a different mind set. I was interested in learning
                    a
                    new way of thinking about programming.</p>

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    Curious about the linguistics differences between dialects of English beyond spelling
                    differences,
                    such as British English, Canadian English, American English, etc. With the massive amount of
                    writings available online, it is the perfect mix of linguistics and computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To simplify the project for a 5-day hack, I focused on word choices and frequencies, using term
                    frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) as a measure. News articles were used in the
                    project.
                    As a starting point, journalism genre is a cleaner form of writing in terms of spelling and
                    sentence structure, while the quality of other forms of writing available online such as blogs,
                    posts and tweets might vary from person to person. I picked CBC and BBC and "Zika virus" as the
                    topic to further narrow down the amount of information.
                </p>
                <h4>Methodology</h4>
                <p>
                    The project is completed solely in Python. I used the library "Beautiful Soup" for pulling data
                    out
                    of HTML files. Then I used the tf-idf vectorizer provided in scikit-learn library. Finally, the
                    tf-idf information is passed onto a library named "wordcloud" for visualization.
                </p>
