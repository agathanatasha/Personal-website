                        <p>ROP is a program designed to provide an opportunity for degree students in their second-year in the Faculty of Arts and Science to work on the research project of a professor in return for a full year course credit. <br>
                        I studied the effect of musical training on adult second language syntax learning with <a href="http://utoronto.academia.edu/HenriettaLempert">Prof. Henrietta Lempert</a>. I was involved in every stage of the study, from literature review to data collection and analysis. At the end of the course, the study and results are presented in a poster fair.<br>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/15-16/dpt/cxinfr08010.htm"target="_blank">Informatics 2D: Reasoning and Agents</a></li>
                        <p>This course focuses on approaches relating to representation, reasoning and planning for solving real world inference. The course illustrates the importance of (i) using a smart representation of knowledge such that it is conducive to efficient reasoning, and (ii) the need for exploiting task constraints for intelligent search and planning. The notion of representing action, space and time is formalized in the context of agents capable of sensing the environment and taking actions that affect the current state. There is also a strong emphasis on the ability to deal with uncertain data in real world scenarios and hence, the planning and reasoning methods are extended to include inference in probabilistic domains.</p>
                    <li><a href="http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/15-16/dpt/cxlasc10062.htm"target="_blank">Speech Synthesis</a></li>
                        <p>This course explores text-to-speech synthesis by taking a detailed look at the theory and practice of current speech synthesis systems, including the two main approaches to speech synthesis, text selection and recording data for corpus based approaches, searching inventories for unit selection approaches, prosody, pitch tracking, The <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/" target="_blank">Festival speech synthesis system</a>, speech coding for speech synthesis, statistical parametric speech synthesis, evaluation, and current research issues in speech synthesis. As an assignmnet, students built their own synthetic voice for a unit selection speech synthesiser with the Festival speech synthesis system.</p>
                    <li><a href="http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/15-16/dpt/cxlasc11113.htm"target="_blank">Simulating Language</a></li>
                        <p>In this course, we will build and run experiments with very simple models that nevertheless cast light on a wide range of puzzles - from the origins of animal communication all the way to the emergence of patterns of regularity and irregularity in language structure. Each of these models will build on the previous ones and at each step we will relate the practical work we are doing with the existing literature on simulating language, as well as broader issues in the scientific understanding of the origins and ongoing evolution of language. This course discusses the dynamic processes underpinning language, including individual learning, cultural transmission, and biological evolution. It will involve a mix of practical lab work, lectures and discussions.</p>
